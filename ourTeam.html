						<h2>Jason Martin</h2>
						<p class="profileTitle">Director</p>
						<p class="bio">Unusually for this industry, Jason graduated with a degree in industrial
							engineering and had a career as a business analyst before he decided to explore his creative
							side and become a stylist. This balance of analysis and creativity means he has developed a
							unique problem-solving approach to hairdressing that allows him to design and style his
							clients’ hair to perfection. After working at one of Auckland’s top salons for almost 12
							years, Jason opened Sadal & Co Hair Salon to bring the hairdressing experience back to being
							more about the customer, as opposed to the creative and artistic motivations of the
							industry. </p>

						<h2>Casey Taylor</h2>
						<p class="profileTitle">Master Stylist</p>
						<p class="bio">After gaining her stripes as a stylist at Servilles in Newmarket back in the
							early 2000s, Lisa subsequently moved on to work at top salons in Sydney and London over a
							period of 7 years. A self-professed obsessive compulsive, she can cut, colour and sculpt
							hair to perfection with effortless poise. Undeniably modest and humble, she is truly the
							definition of an artisan and master hairdresser. In her spare time she can be found
							straightening crooked picture frames and indulging her culinary ambitions preparing Italian
							and Asian masterpieces. </p>
